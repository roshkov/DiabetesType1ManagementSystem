## Description
This project explores the application of process-oriented and event-driven software systems for the daily management of type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition affecting insulin production, necessitating external insulin administration based on food intake, blood sugar levels, and other factors. Patients with type 1 diabetes require significant lifestyle adjustments to maintain their health and avoid severe complications. To address these challenges, the project investigates the use of software to facilitate type 1 diabetes management. The approach involves identifying essential patient processes, integrating additional data sources for comprehensive blood sugar insights, and utilizing Camunda for process modeling and execution, along with Siddhi for real-time event processing and user interactions.


## Configuration
For Docker-From-Docker to work correctly, you must enable "Terminal > Inherit Env" inside VSCode. This enables the dev container to collect the repo's directory from the host into an environmental variable for use with docker inside the container.

### Windows
For use in windows, I suggest you clone this repo into the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2). This gives docker an easier time figuring out exactly where your project folder is when it needs to mount.
To clone the repo into WSL2, open up the WSL2 terminal, this brings you to your home directory under WSL2. [Create an ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) as such 
```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

let it save into the default folder, give it no passphrase.
Type in this command: 
```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```
and then type this 
```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_xxxxx
```
where the x's correspond to the id that was just created.

Now type in
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_xxxxx.pub
```
again where the x's correspond to the id, and copy the output and add this to your githubs ssh keys.

Now finally type in
```
git clone git@github.com:tina5kova/POEDSS.git 
```
This shall clone it into a folder named ` POEDSS `

  When opening VSCode to find the folder location, select "Open Folder" and into the top bar type in "//wsl$/" and find the folder from there. It is usually in /Ubuntu-xxxx/home/USERNAME/" to where you have cloned the repo.

## Running

`make up-camunda` runs the containers: Siddhi, Camunda + Database. 
`poetry run poedss [speed]` runs the python command to stream the data. 
`make down-camunda` brings down the docker containers.

``` 
$ make up-camunda
$ poetry run poedss [speed]
$ make down-camunda
$ sudo docker logs services_siddhi_1 -f
```

## Useful for developing

Rebuilding external api-endpoint and connecting to logs
```
$ make rebuild-logs-external
```

Rebuilding Siddhi and connecting to logs right away
```
$ make restart-logs-siddhi
```
